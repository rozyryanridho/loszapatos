          <p>Through sports, we have the power to change lives. Sports keep us fit. They keep us mindful. They bring us together. Athletes inspire us. They help us to get up and get moving. And sporting goods featuring the latest technologies help us beat our personal best. adidas is home to the runner, the basketball player, the soccer kid, the fitness enthusiast, the yogi. And even the weekend hiker looking to escape the city. The 3-Stripes are everywhere and anywhere. In sports. In music. On life’s stages. Before the whistle blows, during the race, and at the finish line. We’re here to support creators. To improve their game. To live their lives. And to change the world.</p>
